In the UK, fisheries contribute less than 0.05% to national GDP, however there are some regions where fisheries provide the mainstay of employment and are vitally important to the local economy. While fishermen account for a small percentage of the national workforce (0.2% in Scotland)

The fishing industry is also a significant component of Scotland's rural economy, for example in the North East and West Highland, Orkney and Shetland the value of landings accounts for approximately 6% of the area's GDP.

In the UK, fisheries contribute less than 0.05% to national GDP, however there are some regions where fisheries provide the mainstay of employment and are vitally important to the local economy. While fishermen account for a small percentage of the national workforce (0.2% in Scotland)

The fishing industry is also a significant component of Scotland's rural economy, for example in the North East and West Highland, Orkney and Shetland the value of landings accounts for approximately 6% of the area's GDP.
